I understand perfectly! You want to create a professional, minimal super admin dashboard similar to the marketplace UI design - clean, simple, but sophisticated. Let me first examine the marketplace UI to understand the design patterns, then create a comprehensive plan.

Perfect! I can see the design patterns from the marketplace. Now let me plan the super admin dashboard with the same clean, professional aesthetic.

Based on the marketplace design patterns, here's my comprehensive plan for the super admin dashboard:

## Super Admin Dashboard Plan

**Design Philosophy**: Clean, minimal, professional - following the marketplace's approach with:
- White backgrounds with subtle shadows
- Blue accent colors (blue-600, blue-800)
- Clean typography with proper hierarchy
- Card-based layouts
- Subtle hover effects and transitions

### Phase-by-Phase Implementation:

**Phase 1: Core Layout & Navigation**
- `/admin` route with professional sidebar/drawer navigation
- Responsive layout that matches marketplace aesthetics
- Navigation items: Dashboard, Users, Analytics, System Health, Settings, Audit Logs

**Phase 2: Dashboard Overview**
- Key platform metrics cards (Users, Revenue, System Load, etc.)
- Recent activity feed
- Quick action buttons
- Charts and graphs (mock data)

**Phase 3: User Management**
- User list with search/filter
- User details modal
- Role management
- Bulk actions (mock functionality)

**Phase 4: Analytics & Metrics**
- Platform usage analytics
- Performance metrics
- Revenue tracking
- User engagement stats

**Phase 5: System Health**
- Server status monitoring
- Database health
- API performance
- Error tracking

**Phase 6: Admin Settings**
- Platform configuration
- Feature flags
- Notification settings
- System preferences

**Phase 7: Audit Logs**
- Activity tracking
- User actions log
- System events
- Export functionality

Each section will have:
- Mock data that looks realistic
- Functional UI interactions
- Professional forms with validation states
- Loading states and empty states
- Consistent styling matching the marketplace

Should I proceed with Phase 1 - creating the core admin layout and navigation structure?
