do not use emojis as icons, do not use emojis, do not use emoji, we need to keep design minimalistic and professional



Hi,
Let’s align everything with the feedback we’ve received. from demo we did The current visuals and dashboard didn’t meet the standard this needs to be corrected immediately.

Here’s what needs to happen:

Remove all emojis and informal elements from the site.

Make the entire website minimalist, professional, and enterprise-grade no exceptions.

Rename all products with technically complex, serious names. These should reflect advanced AI, automation, and cloud-native capabilities.

Focus heavily on cloud applications, especially those tied to AI, automation, and data recording these are the core.

We need at least 7 new enterprise-level applications conceptualized and added to the site. These don’t need to be fully functional yet, but they must appear polished and production-ready.

All product images must be clean, high-end, and professional no casual styles or placeholders.

Make sure nothing is copied  especially from the homepage (e.g., logos, sections). Everything must be original and elevated.

Every single page of the website must be fully responsive, functional, and production-ready desktop, tablet, and mobile.

The dashboard is currently underwhelming. I’ll be sending over some reference examples. Review them carefully and redesign accordingly this must look modern and enterprise-ready.

The next client presentation is on September 17th. Everything must be aligned and finalized before then.

This is top priority make sure your full focus is on this.
