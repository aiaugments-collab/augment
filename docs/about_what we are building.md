Here’s a **clear, professional breakdown** of what you’re trying to do with *Augment* (the unified dashboard), and exactly how adding each new product will work. This is written as if you’re explaining it to your client, your team, or even investors — while also serving as a practical blueprint for you as a developer.

## **Project Overview: Augment — Unified page for AI Products**

**Goal:**
Create a single **parent platform (Augment)** that presents all AI products as separate modules. Each module will have:

1. Its **own standalone application** (admin + user panel).
2. A **dedicated landing page** for marketing/demo purposes.
3. A **link from Augment’s main dashboard**, so everything feels unified under one brand.

**Positioning:**
Instead of building one giant monolithic platform, we’re building **multiple focused MVPs** that share a common presentation layer (Augment). Think *Oracle Cloud console* or *Zoho marketplace* — a central hub with separate apps you can explore.

## **1. What Augment Will Do**

* **Unified Landing Page:**

  * Public-facing marketing site.
  * Describes the Augment vision and lists all AI products (cards/tiles with branding).
  * Each product card links to:

    * Its *landing page* (deep info, screenshots, pitch).
    * Its *app* (where users can sign in and test the product).

* **Unified Dashboard (Internal):**

  * Once logged in, users (or investors during demo) see a **catalog view of all apps**.
  * This is NOT a shared backend — just a **hub page** that links to each product’s own URL and authentication system.
  * We can use Firebase (simple) for authentication here, just to gate access if needed.

* **Brand Consistency:**

  * Every app will feel like it belongs to the Augment family: consistent logo placement, color scheme, typography.
  * The Augment dashboard itself serves as the “front door” to all modules.

## **2. How New Products Will Be Added**

Each new product follows the same development flow:

1. **Build the App MVP**

   * Start with a **Next.js dashboard template** (to save time).
   * Implement **basic auth**, **simple admin panel**, and **core AI logic**.
   * Only focus on features necessary to demo — no scaling, no deep edge cases.
   * Example: If it’s a sales AI, just show “upload lead list → AI drafts email → see result”.

2. **Create Its Landing Page**

   * This is a standalone **marketing page**.
   * Includes hero section, key benefits, 2-3 screenshots, demo video (if possible).
   * CTA buttons: **Try Demo** or **Request Access** → link directly into the app.
   * Keep it **beautiful but fast to build** — use templates or Tailwind UI.

3. **Integrate Into Augment**

   * On Augment’s main dashboard:

     * Add the product as a **new card/tile** (title, logo, 2-line description).
     * Link that tile to:

       * **Product Landing Page (marketing)**
       * **Direct App URL (demo)**
   * Optionally add *“coming soon”* tag if the app isn’t ready yet.

## **3. Why This Approach Works for MVP**

* **Fast Iteration:**
  By copying repo structure and reusing components, building a new app becomes mostly “copy-paste → delete → add specific logic.”

* **Investor-Friendly:**
  The unified dashboard shows **vision** (a suite of apps), while each app MVP shows **progress** (we can already do this much).

* **Modular Scaling Later:**
  If funding comes, you can rewrite or expand individual products without breaking the whole suite.

## **4. Example Flow (Step-by-step)**

Let’s say you’re adding “AI Sales Caller” (like altur.io):

1. Duplicate your base Next.js template repo.
2. Implement minimal features: upload phone numbers → AI simulates calls → show success logs.
3. Deploy app at `salescaller.augment.ai`.
4. Create landing page at `augment.ai/salescaller`.
5. Add product card in Augment’s main dashboard → link to landing page and app.
6. Done. Repeat for next agent.

Do you want me to **turn this into a full developer guideline** — with **repo structure, naming conventions, and Cursor AI instructions** — so you can crank out these apps quickly without losing track? Or do you want me to first **write it as a client-facing project plan document** so you can send it to them?
